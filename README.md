 ## Application Design

### HTML Files

The application will consist of two HTML files:

* `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will contain a form that allows the user to enter a public figure name. When the user submits the form, the application will call Dall-E to create a picture that looks like the person.
* `results.html`: This page will display the image that was created by Dall-E.

### Routes

The application will have two routes:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/results`: This route will render the `results.html` file.

### Flask Application

The Flask application will be responsible for handling the requests from the user and calling Dall-E to create the images. The application will also be responsible for rendering the HTML files.

The following code shows the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import dall_e

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/results', methods=['POST'])
def results():
    name = request.form['name']
    image = dall_e.create_image(name)
    return render_template('results.html', image=image)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Conclusion

This application demonstrates how to use Flask to create a web application that calls Dall-E to create images. The application is easy to use and can be used to create images of any public figure.
